# VowelsDiscordBot
A simple discord Bot made in JavaScript that counts the # of vowels in a message and responds back

Options/Commands:  
!replymode mention - I will only reply to messages that I'm tagged in (default)
!replymode all - I will reply to all messages in the server (I may be a bit annoying!)
